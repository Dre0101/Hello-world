# string Library python

in the project i created a virtual Library filled with diffrent methods for use of strings; these include the following:
- is_digit =  a built-in string method used to check whether a string consists only of digits (0–9). (If all characters in the string are digits, the method returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
- to_lower = a string method is used to convert all uppercase letters in a string to lowercase.
- is_alpha =  string method that checks whether all the characters in a string are alphabetic. It returns True if all characters are letters (a–z or A–Z) and False otherwise.

One of the challenges I faced while working on this program was a common SyntaxError, instead of me restarting I went line by line to find the problem then properly changed it so it can call the funntion

i also demonsrtated calling a function with using the following below 
- replace_chr(s, old, new) = A code more for adding additional checks and behavior.
- find_chr(s, char) = A method that returns the index of the first occurrence of char in s.
